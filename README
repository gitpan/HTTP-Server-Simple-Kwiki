NAME
    HTTP::Server::Simple::Kwiki - Standalone Kwiki server

SYNOPSIS
      use HTTP::Server::Simple::Kwiki;

      chdir "my-kwiki"; 
      my $server = HTTP::Server::Simple::Kwiki->new();
      $server->run();

DESCRIPTION
    HTTP::Server::Simple::Kwiki is a standalone webserver for Kwiki. This
    means that you don't need to run it under a proper webserver. This is
    intended mostly for debugging Kwiki, or for when you just want to play
    with it without having to configure Apache.

    Note that all you need to do is write a script like in the synopsis,
    remembering to chdir into your Kwiki directory.
